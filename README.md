## Summary
This project was fun and challenging! I enjoyed learning how to properly leverage the Twitter API to obtain specific information about Twitter users and tweets. It was aslo exciting to come up with creative ways to deconstruct and render the information that was sent back from the API. Overall, this project gave me a better understanding about how applications interact with each other to send and receive information, and the role that servers (in this case a NodeJS server) play in that transaction.
